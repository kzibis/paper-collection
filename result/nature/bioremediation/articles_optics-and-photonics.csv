/articles/s41467-019-11212-x,Quantum biological tunnel junction for electron transfer imaging in live cells,"Although quantum biological electron transfer is important in many biological processes, imaging of the events in live cells has remained challenging. Here, the authors demonstrate real-time optical detection of quantum biological electron tunnelling between nanoparticles and cytochrome c inside living cells.","nature, search, Hongbao Xin, Wen Jing Sim, Luke P.
