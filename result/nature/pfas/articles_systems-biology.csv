/articles/s41467-024-50405-x,Host cell CRISPR genomics and modelling reveal shared metabolic vulnerabilities in the intracellular development of Plasmodium falciparum and related hemoparasites,"Maurizio and Masid et al. identify common host metabolic pathways essential forPlasmodium falciparumandTheileriaparasites, revealing potential for developing shared broad-spectrum antiparasitic therapies to more effectively combat these debilitating infections.","nature, search, Marina Maurizio, Maria Masid, Philipp Olias, Erez Persi, Miquel Duran-Frigola, Eytan Ruppin, Joram M. Posma, Isabel Garcia-Perez, Jeremy K. Nicholson, Léa Maitre, Mariona Bustamante, Martine Vrijheid, Ruohong Wang, Yandong Yin, Zheng-Jiang Zhu",21 Jul 2024
/articles/s41467-018-05261-x,Systems analysis of intracellular pH vulnerabilities for cancer therapy,"Tumors often exhibit a pH gradient, with an acidic extracellular space and alkaline cytoplasm. Here the authors develop a computational model to show how alkaline pHi supports changes inherent to cancer cell metabolism and acidification disables these adaptations, and demonstrate the effect of acidic pHi on breast cancer cell survival.","nature, search, Marina Maurizio, Maria Masid, Philipp Olias, Erez Persi, Miquel Duran-Frigola, Eytan Ruppin, Joram M. Posma, Isabel Garcia-Perez, Jeremy K. Nicholson, Léa Maitre, Mariona Bustamante, Martine Vrijheid, Ruohong Wang, Yandong Yin, Zheng-Jiang Zhu",21 Jul 2024
/articles/s43016-020-0093-y,Nutriome–metabolome relationships provide insights into dietary intake and metabolism,"Urinary metabolic phenotyping of 1,848 adults in the United States shows that 46 structurally identified metabolites were influenced by intakes of 67 nutrients, and accurately predicted healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns. These urinary biomarkers are diet-derived, stable, measurable and associated with disease risk, thereby representing an advance on traditional ways of obtaining information about dietary patterns.","nature, search, Marina Maurizio, Maria Masid, Philipp Olias, Erez Persi, Miquel Duran-Frigola, Eytan Ruppin, Joram M.

/articles/s41467-022-34422-2,Multi-omics signatures of the human early life exposome,"Environmental exposures in early life can have lasting health effects, but the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here, the authors discover >1000 associations between exposure factors and child multi-omics profiles, revealing signatures for diet, toxic chemical compounds, essential trace elements, and weather conditions.","nature, search, Marina Maurizio, Maria Masid, Philipp Olias, Erez Persi, Miquel Duran-Frigola, Eytan Ruppin, Joram M.

/articles/s41467-022-31268-6,Global stable-isotope tracing metabolomics reveals system-wide metabolic alternations in aging Drosophila,"Stable-isotope tracing allows quantifying metabolic activity by measuring isotopically labeled metabolites, but its metabolome coverage has been limited. Here, the authors develop a global isotope tracing approach with metabolome-wide coverage and use it to characterize metabolic activities in agingDrosophila.","nature, search, Marina Maurizio, Maria Masid, Philipp Olias, Erez Persi, Miquel Duran-Frigola, Eytan Ruppin, Joram M.
