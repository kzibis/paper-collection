/articles/s41467-024-49018-1,The link between ancient microbial fluoride resistance mechanisms and bioengineering organofluorine degradation or synthesis,"Microbial degradation and biosynthesis of fluorinated compounds is a field of increasing importance, but is hampered by the significant toxicity of fluoride. Here authors discuss emerging ideas on microbial defluorination/fluorination and fluoride resistance mechanisms, providing guidance on how this knowledge can guide future bioengineering approaches.","nature, search, Randy B.

/articles/s44221-023-00077-6,Substantial defluorination of polychlorofluorocarboxylic acids triggered by anaerobic microbial hydrolytic dechlorination,"Physicochemical defluorination is arguably the best pathway to degrade polyfluoroalkyl substances. In the case of chlorinated polyfluorocarboxylic acids, it is shown that substantial defluorination can be achieved by an anaerobic microbial community via novel pathways triggered by anaerobic hydrolytic dechlorination.","nature, search, Randy B.
