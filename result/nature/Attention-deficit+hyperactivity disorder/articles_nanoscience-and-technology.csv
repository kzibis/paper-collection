/articles/s41467-021-27361-x,Breaking the barrier to biomolecule limit-of-detection via 3D printed multi-length-scale graphene-coated electrodes,"Here, the authors introduce a biosensing platform with multi-length-scale electrode architecture consisting of 3D printed silver micropillars decorated with graphene flakes. They demonstrate that this breaks a barrier to the biomolecule limit-of-detection, enabling detection down to femtomolar level.","nature, search, Md.

/articles/s41467-019-12035-6,Gaussian synapses for probabilistic neural networks,"Designing large-scale hardware implementation of Probabilistic Neural Network for energy efficient neuromorphic computing systems remains a challenge. Here, the authors propose an hardware design based on MoS2/BP heterostructures as reconfigurable Gaussian synapses enabling EEG patterns recognition.","nature, search, Md.
