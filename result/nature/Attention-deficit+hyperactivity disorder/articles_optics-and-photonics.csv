/articles/srep30157,Prefrontal responses to Stroop tasks in subjects with post-traumatic stress disorder assessed by functional near infrared spectroscopy,"Identification of neurotransmitters remains challenging for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) due to presence of noise. Here, the authors present spread spectrum SERS, which by encoding excited light and decoding SERS signals enables detection of unlabelled neurotransmitters at attomolar concentrations.","nature, search, Amarnath Yennu, Fenghua Tian, Hanli Liu, Wonkyoung Lee, Byoung-Hoon Kang, Ki-Hun Jeong, Matthew Dunn, Adam Henke, Dalibor Sames",25 Jul 2016

/articles/s41467-018-05075-x,Designing a norepinephrine optical tracer for imaging individual noradrenergic synapses and their activity in vivo,"The noradrenergic system plays numerous physiological roles but tools to study it are scarce. Here the authors develop a fluorescent analogue of norepinephrine that can be used to label noradrenergic neurons and the synaptic vesicles, and use it to measure single synaptic vesicle release sites in living mice.","nature, search, Amarnath Yennu, Fenghua Tian, Hanli Liu, Wonkyoung Lee, Byoung-Hoon Kang, Ki-Hun Jeong, Matthew Dunn, Adam Henke, Dalibor Sames",25 Jul 2016
